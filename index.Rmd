# CellexalvrR - the R package powering CellexalVR

CellexalvrR is the initial backend of the single cell analysis software CellexalVR.
It implements main features of the VR software as calculating differentials, correlation networks and gene gene correlations. In addition the R package keeps track of the actions in VR and creates a html log of each VR session including all statistical tables, screenshots and more information.

The main functionallity a 'normal' VR user is going to need is the import of a variety of data formats like a R Seurat object, Python AnnData objects or even FACS data.
